var | is use to make a variable can be change (var m = 1)(var m = 3) so you can make a multipler
     variable on var |
you can uyse only undrscore _ or symbol's 
firstname (valid)
_firstnaem (valid)
1value (invalid)
value1 (vlalid)
first name (invalid)
first_name (valid) also it is called snake case
First_Name (valid) also it is called camel case
let keyword | it is also like  a variable but when you make (let m = 'n') so can 
  not make another variable on this name like (let m = "m") it will show erorr! |

const | it will be constant and can be change and you can not be change it letter
string indexing " so like other languages js also start indexing from 0 "[0]
lengt " it is use to find the length of the string"
length -1 "it is use to print name from reverse"
trim()  "it is use to remove the spaces from your contant "
toUpperCase() == MMMSASMDM
toLowwerCase() == hasfhakj
slice()  " it is use for printing indexes from start to end
            {name.slice(1,3)}"
typeof "so it is use to find something as type for example
        console.log(typeof 7) == number "
age = age + "" --> "the number which is store in age will
            be change to string "22"
      {let age = 22 ;
      // type converstion
      age = age + "" ;
      console.log(typeof age ); }

String()    "it is the another methood to change the type of number 
toString()  to string like String(age) "
      {let age = 19;
      age = String(age);
      age = age.toString();
      console.log(typeof age);}

Number() "it is use to change the string to number like Number(age)
          
          {let age = "19";
          age = Number(age);
          console.log(typeof age);  
}

concatination can also be done in js like (m + n) so it wil print the string of those two and give the output 
templet string "it is use to make easy our work in the coding so we can 
                concatinate the value easy like we use ${age } it dose not work with ("") it work with (``) "
undefined "so when we make an empty variable and did'nt acen it the value
            in result it give us an undefined"
BigINt "so there is a limite of storing a number in js we can maximame store of to 
          9007199254740991 to store a value upper than it we use bigint BigINt(23423423) or 234n and also you can not use it with int"
(== 1|2 ===| != | !==| >= |<=) "1 so it is like the other programing languages but here it don't 
                           check the datatype it check the given value [2] = so it is the same but it wil check the datatype"
{ let n = "3";
let m = 3;
console.log("this is == not for datatype only in js " +n == m);
console.log("this is === for data type " + m === n);
console.log("this is != not for the " + m != n);
console.log("this is !== datatype " + m !== n);  }

ternary operator "so the ternary can write the conditional statement in one line we can 
                  write it easy like (let drink = age >= 18 ? "wine" : "milk";)"
else if "so it is use as like in python and c and java we will put it after if for multipul 
          condition "
while "so it is a while loop use for the contiouse output in js like |
       i = 0 |while(condition){statement and decrement }|"
for loop "so it is the for loop and use for the contiouse output in js like 
           for ( insilisation |condition | decrement){now statement }"
switch "it is use to track like 
        switch(variable) {
            case 1 :
                      break;
            case 2 : 
                      break;
                      defult:
                             console.log()
            }"
  break "it is use to stop something "
  contiouse "it is use to skip something"   
arry `it is use to store the collection of data like arry (let arry = [`mango`,`apple`,`milk`];) 
      arry[0] it will be the indexing of arry ` 
Array.isArray "it is use to check that the variable is array or not(Array.isArray(name))"
array.push "it is use to push something in the end of your arry (name.push)"
array.pop " it is use to remove from the last also you can add it in the variable "
Array.unshift "to add in starting and also we can store it in variable and also can run it "
array.shift  "use to remove from starting we can also store it in the variable "
      let a = ["mamonkhan","maf","ajf"];
      console.log(a);
      let arrypop = a.pop();
      console.log(a);
      a.unshift("fjalsj");
      console.log(a);
      let ramove_fruit = a.shift();
      console.log(a);
concat "so we can add the arr with like let arr1 = ["mamoonkhan","haroon","amin"];
                                            let arr2 = [].concat(arr1);"
spread_operater "so we can also make a copy of arr1 in arr2 by spread_operater in js like

for of loop " it is use as like for but it will go automitic the length of variable you give like for(let i of ramove_fruit)"
